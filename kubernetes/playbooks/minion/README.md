# Kubernetes minions or nodes

## What is a minion or a node?
A node is a worker machine in Kubernetes, previously known as a minion. A node may be a VM or physical machine, depending on the cluster. Each node has the services necessary to run pods and is managed by the master components. The services on a node include Docker, kubelet and kube-proxy

More about minions or node components can be found [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/nodes/)
